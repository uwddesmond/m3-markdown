# Exercise-2

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

#cd
The `cd` command allows you to change your directory. For example:
```
cd Documents/
```
Here's some information about the `cd` command:

- You can use the `~` to go back to the user and then change directory. Option: `cd ~/Documents/`

- You can use `..` to move back up the directory tree


A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.
